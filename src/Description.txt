HW


This is my first project in java, it was interesting to say the least...
I could not get ARC to Work.
I used a breathe first search.
I barrowed the robotparser from a gnu public sorce to parse robot.txt
Everything else i learned painstakingly by myself with a bit of help from Ben Classen, he was incredibly helpful.

Im not sure i got the correct amount of links, i hit 300. I hope it was enough.
